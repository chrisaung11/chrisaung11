# Ongoing Projects List: 

## 🎨 Front-End Projects

### JavaScript

- **Note Taker**: A user-friendly app for note-taking. Features include emailing notes and exporting as PDF. This project is 50% done but the other 50% is the hard part. I have many more ideas to create this and create something similar to Notion.

### React

- **Netflix Mock UI**: A project to replicate and innovate upon the Netflix UI. To make my own Netflix Mock UI in React, I'd first set up the main layout using React components. Then I'd style it with CSS to look like Netflix. I'd use APIs to get movie and show data and show them in different categories on the screen. I'd also add user login and a way to play videos. This way, I get to practice using React by creating something similar to Netflix.

## 🛠 Back-End Projects

### Node.js

- **Calendar API**: Building a personalized calendar API, as I would prefer more flexibilty and control than what Google Calendar offers. A personalized Calendar API in Node.js, set up a server using Express. Create basic functions to add, view, edit, and delete events. Use a database like MongoDB to save these events. Add user login for security. 

### Python

- **Chat Server**: A real-time chat server using WebSockets. Deploy it on a cloud platform and share the public IP or domain with your organization. Ensure the firewall allows WebSocket connections and consider adding authentication for security. Once set up, your group can enjoy real-time chatting.

Household Inventory Management System using MySQL, a database to store information about products, groceries, and other items.

## 🌐 API Projects

- **Stock Tracker**: A real-time Stock Tracker, APIs like Yahoo Finance to retrieve current stock prices. The back-end will be built with Node.js for API requests and data processing. On the front-end, a dashboard built with would display the data. WebSockets could be used for real-time updates, refreshing stock prices without requiring manual user intervention.
